# Write a program containing the following functions

# Function 1: 
# - accept a name, return True if it is valid or False otherwise. A name is valid
#   if it has 6-15 characters of all letters or digits only. The first character
#   must be a letter. 

# Function 2: accept a password, return True if it is valid or False otherwise. 
# - a password is valid if it has 6-15 characters. The first character must be
#   a letter or a digit. A password must have at least one lower letter, one upper
#   letter, one digit, one special character. The password must has no space nor comma.

# Function 3: 
# - accept a file name, return no value. The function keeps on reading new name 
#   and password, write them to a file of the given name in csv format. That is,
#   one line for a pair of name and password, comma seperated. Repeat reading name 
#   if name is invalid or name already exists. Repeat reading password if it is invalid. 

# Function 4:
# - accept a file name. Assume the file contains names and passwords in CSV format.
#   Read from the file all names and passwords, add them into two parallel lists.
#   Return the two lists.

# Function 5: 
# - accept two parallel lists for all names and all passwords, and the maximum 
#   number of allowed attemps. Read name and password from the user until a match
#   is found in the two lists, or the maximum attempts have been reached.

# Write the main() to test all functions above.
